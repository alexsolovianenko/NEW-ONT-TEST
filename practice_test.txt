**Answers**

*Note: The answers provided are examples and may vary based on the student's perspective and interpretation of the content.*

**Section 1: Thinking**
1. The operating system manages the computer's resources and provides a user interface for interaction, while utility programs perform specific tasks related to managing computer resources.
2. Information is data that has been processed and has a meaningful context, while data is raw, unprocessed facts. For example, a student's raw test scores are data, while their final grade (calculated from the test scores) is information.
3. The CPU's processing speed is measured in cycles per second (Hz). This measurement is important as it indicates how many instructions the CPU can execute in a second.
4. Source code is written in high-level programming languages. It is the set of instructions that a programmer writes in a programming language.
5. Flash memory is a type of non-volatile memory that can be electrically erased and reprogrammed. It is used for storage and data transfer in computers and other digital devices.

**Section 2: Communication**
1. System software manages and controls the computer hardware, for example, the operating system. Application software performs specific tasks for the user, for example, a word processing program.
2. Answers will vary.
3. An interpreter translates high-level source code into machine code line by line, executing each line immediately after translation.
4. A compiler translates the entire source code into machine code before execution.
5. High-level programming languages are more abstract and easier for humans to use. Interpreters and compilers were necessary to translate these high-level languages into machine code that the computer could understand.

**Section 3: Knowledge**
1. c) None of the above
2. b) Charles Babbage
3. b) Arithmetic Logical Unit
4. d) All of the above
5. a) Flash

**Section 4: Application**
1. The three factors used to determine the power of a computer are processing speed, memory capacity, and storage capacity.
2. A personal computer is primarily used for individual tasks like browsing the web, creating documents, or playing games. Its level of processing power is sufficient for these tasks.
3. A supercomputer is used for complex tasks that require immense calculations, such as weather forecasting, climate research, or physical simulations. Its high level of processing power is necessary for these tasks.
