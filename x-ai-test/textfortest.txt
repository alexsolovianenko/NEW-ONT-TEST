Solutions
Section A - Knowledge
b) Metaphase - Chromosomes align along the equator of the cell.
b) Metaphase – chromosomes align - Correctly matches phase and event.
b) Growth and repair of cells - Mitosis produces identical somatic cells.
b) Spindle fiber - Pulls sister chromatids to opposite poles.
b) Division of cytoplasm - Cytokinesis splits the cell’s contents into two.
Section B - Application
a) They are genetically identical to each other and the parent cell - Mitosis preserves DNA.
b) In a healing wound - Rapid cell division replaces damaged tissue.
b) 46 - Each daughter cell receives a full set of chromosomes.
a) Interphase - It precedes mitosis but is not part of it.
b) It allows for growth and tissue repair - Mitosis maintains organism function.
Section C - Thinking
DNA must duplicate so each daughter cell receives an exact copy of genetic material.
By duplicating chromosomes and dividing evenly, mitosis maintains identical DNA in cells.
Mitosis creates identical diploid cells; meiosis forms haploid cells with variation.
Chromosomes would not separate properly, leading to unequal DNA distribution.
Errors can cause uncontrolled cell growth or mutation, leading to cancer.
Section D - Communication
PMAT is like organizing a play: Prophase (setup), Metaphase (line-up), Anaphase (split-up), Telophase (cleanup).
Use microscope slides or animations showing real mitotic stages.
Use side-by-side diagrams showing cleavage furrow (animal) vs. cell plate (plant).
Summarize that mitosis ensures identical cells for growth and repair—“copy and paste” for life.
Like copying a blueprint—one mistake replicates across all new structures.
