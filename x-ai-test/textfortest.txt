Solutions

Section A - Knowledge
1. b) Transfer of electrons from one atom to another - Ionic bonds form when one atom donates electrons to another, creating oppositely charged ions that attract.
2. b) The ability of an atom to attract shared electrons in a bond - Electronegativity measures how strongly an atom pulls on bonding electrons.
3. b) Decreases from left to right, increases down a group - Atomic radius decreases across a period due to increasing nuclear charge, and increases down a group as new electron shells are added.
4. b) Participate in chemical bonding - Valence electrons are the outermost electrons that form bonds between atoms.
5. b) They conduct electricity when dissolved in water - When dissolved, ionic compounds dissociate into ions that can carry electric current.

Section B - Application
1. b) Calculate their electronegativity difference - A large electronegativity difference (>1.7) indicates an ionic bond will form.
2. a) Electron transfer from calcium to oxygen - Calcium loses 2 electrons and oxygen gains 2 electrons to form Ca²⁺ and O²⁻ ions.
3. b) Analyze the symmetry and electronegativity differences - A molecule is polar if it has polar bonds and an asymmetric shape.
4. a) The octet rule and valence electron counting - Lewis structures are drawn by distributing valence electrons to satisfy the octet rule.
5. c) It increases from left to right - Ionization energy increases across a period because atoms hold electrons more tightly as nuclear charge increases.

Section C - Thinking
1. Electronegativity is crucial because it allows us to predict bond type (ionic vs covalent vs polar covalent), molecular polarity, and resulting physical properties like solubility and boiling point. It explains why certain atoms share electrons while others transfer them completely.

2. If there were no electronegativity difference, the bond would be purely covalent with equal electron sharing. This occurs in diatomic molecules like H₂ or O₂, where both atoms have identical electronegativity values and pull equally on shared electrons.

3. Atomic radius and ionization energy are inversely related because as atomic radius decreases (moving left to right), the valence electrons are closer to the nucleus and more strongly attracted. This makes them harder to remove, resulting in higher ionization energy.

4. The high melting points of ionic compounds indicate very strong electrostatic attractions between oppositely charged ions. Large amounts of energy are required to overcome these forces and separate the ions in the crystal lattice.

5. Noble gases are unreactive because they have complete valence electron shells (8 electrons, or 2 for helium), making them extremely stable. They have no tendency to gain, lose, or share electrons since they already satisfy the octet rule.

Section D - Communication
1. Ionic bonding is like a complete transfer - one atom gives electrons to another, like donating money. Covalent bonding is like sharing - atoms hold electrons together, like sharing a blanket. Ionic bonds form between metals and nonmetals, while covalent bonds typically form between nonmetals.

2. A graph or chart showing trends across periods and down groups is most effective. Color-coded periodic tables or line graphs clearly demonstrate how properties like atomic radius, ionization energy, and electronegativity change in predictable patterns.

3. A step-by-step flowchart or numbered procedure with diagrams would be best. Include: (1) count valence electrons, (2) arrange atoms with central atom, (3) form single bonds, (4) distribute remaining electrons, (5) check octet rule, (6) form multiple bonds if needed.

4. Include: (1) the Lewis structure showing bond types, (2) determination of molecular geometry using VSEPR theory, (3) identification of polar bonds based on electronegativity, (4) analysis of molecular symmetry, and (5) final conclusion about overall polarity.

5. Use everyday analogies and visual models. Compare strong ionic bonds to magnets attracting, covalent bonds to handshakes, and relate properties like melting point to real-world examples (salt vs sugar). Avoid technical jargon and use demonstrations or animations to show concepts visually.
